// Package proto contains the protobuf and gRPC definitions for the Promotions service.
//
// This package would normally be generated from the promotions.proto file using
// the protoc compiler with the Go and gRPC plugins. Since the generated code
// is not available, this package provides manual implementations of the
// interfaces and types required by the service.
